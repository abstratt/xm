==

XM is (going to be) a general purpose language for model-driven development.

Key characteristics:
- modular (structure, behavior, dynamics are all modules)
- concrete/abstract syntax separation (multiple concrete syntaxes are possible)

This thing has just started. Your participation is welcome.
